# Quizlet Clone - Flashcard Application

A simple, Quizlet-inspired flashcard application built using Java and the Swing library. This application allows users study, and quiz themselves on sets of vocabulary, all within a clean, user-friendly interface.
> Note: Currently, the application stores data in a way that it can be overwritten later. This approach is not ideal, and I am actively working on improving the data management system to offer a more reliable and persistent solution.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** - Primary language for the application's backend.
- **Swing** - Java GUI widget toolkit to create a cross-platform, lightweight graphical user interface.
